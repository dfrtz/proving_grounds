# Proving Grounds: Experiments and Examples

A combination of lightweight experiments, examples, and more. Too small for their own project,
but big enough to benefit from more than a gist. Use as is, or expand to meet advanced use cases.

> **Note**: "Projects" within this codebase do not provide guarantees around new features being added
or bugs being fixed. Bugs and features are addressed on best effort basis.

## Experiments vs Examples

- If the project version is < 1.0.0, it is considered an "experiment". It is subject to large, breaking, changes.
- If a version is >= 1.0.0, it is considered "stable". The contracts are guaranteed within the major version branch.
